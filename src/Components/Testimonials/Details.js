            '“We’ve been working with Pyramid Developers for over a year now. When we first engaged with them, looking at Dhruv and his young squad, we were sceptical about them providing us with exactly what we wanted.\nTo our surprise they demonstrated a high level of professionalism, they were up to date with the latest technology and executed our projects as per schedule. We’re extremely happy with their work and have now given them our phase 2 projects as well.\nI would highly recommend Pyramid Developers for any Software or Mobile app development activities.”',

     description:'"Pyramid Developers offer a unique approach to app development service by having students run the show. This allowed us to build out an MVP at relatively low cost and provided a good base for future development.\n The design team did a phenomenal job with the app by making it equally aesthetic and functional."',

        description : '"Working with Pyramid Developers to bring AthenaGenAI to life was like hitching a ride on a rocket — fast, exhilarating, and a tiny bit unpredictable due to some space debris (aka external factors). From day one, they grabbed my vision by the horns, gave me a cost estimate that didn\’t make my wallet weep, and zoomed through phase 1 in just three months!\n\n The delivery pace had its ups and downs, but hey, what’s a rollercoaster without a bit of thrill? The team was all-in, bending over backwards to ensure I was more than just happy with the outcome. I even opted for 2 Sprint accelerators, which were worth every penny, propelling us forward like a turbo boost in a video game.\n\nIn a nutshell, Pyramid Developers is the real deal — skilled, committed, and with a sense of humor that makes working with them a breeze. They’re all about building your dreams, one  line at a time. Highly recommend if you want your project done right and with a few laughs along the way!"',
