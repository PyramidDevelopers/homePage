/*
Each project has a key value. Everything follows that order.
So when adding a new project, Detailed Information needs to be in the same order. In ShowDetailsPopUp.js as well
0: NearVibe
1: My Vital Mind
2: Trash To Cash
3: Enerman
4: TakeYourTrip
5: Khushi
6: PoolPay
7: CampX
8: AltFit 

in BreifInformations below, the order is how it'll show up in the site. Key value should match what's above.
